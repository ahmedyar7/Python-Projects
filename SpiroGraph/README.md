# Circle Drawing Turtle

This Python script utilizes the Turtle module to draw a series of concentric circles with random colors. Each circle has an increasing radius, creating a visually appealing pattern.

## Functionality

- The script imports the `turtle` module along with the `Screen` class for creating a turtle graphics window.
- It sets the color mode to RGB to enable the generation of random colors.
- Defines a function `random_color()` to generate random RGB color values.
- Iterates through a loop to draw 1001 circles, each with an increasing radius.
- The `turtle` object rotates slightly after drawing each circle, creating a spiral effect.
- Random colors are applied to each circle using the `random_color()` function.
- The speed of drawing is set to the fastest possible.
- The script keeps the graphics window open until the user closes it manually.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Watch as the turtle draws a mesmerizing pattern of concentric circles with vibrant colors.

Feel free to modify the script to customize the number of circles, color schemes, or drawing speed according to your preferences.
