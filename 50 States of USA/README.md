# USA State Guessing Game (Python with Turtle & Pandas)

This Python program creates a fun and interactive game to test your knowledge of US states!

## How to Play:

1. **Run the Script:** Double-click the `main.py` file or run it from the command line using `python main.py`.
2. **Guess the States:** A map of the USA will appear. You'll be prompted to guess a state name. Type the full state name (e.g., California) and press Enter.
3. **Get Feedback:** If you guess a correct state, its name will be written on the map at its location. The game continues until you guess all 50 states.

## Requirements:

- Python 3
- Necessary libraries:
    - Turtle
    - Pandas (install using `pip install turtle pandas`)

## Files:

- `main.py`: The main game script.
- `blank_states_img.gif`: An image file of a blank US map (replace with your own image if desired).
- `50_states.csv`: A CSV file containing state names, x coordinates, and y coordinates (replace with your own data if desired).

## Customization:

- You can replace the `blank_states_img.gif` file with a different image of a US map.
- You can replace the `50_states.csv` file with your own CSV containing state data (ensure it has columns named "state", "x", and "y").
