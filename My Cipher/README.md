About:
This small project demonstrates the idea of ciphers or coding and decoding of the message by providing essentials like:
•	Coded/Decoded text.
•	Direction to proceed to code of decode.
•	Shift Amount (how many places you want to shift your text)

How I got the Idea: 
	So, I’m a student of NUST Baluchistan Campus so in order to get to any of the NUST Campuses you have to give entrance test, and, in that entrance, test also known as NET there is a section called Intelligence so in that section there are questions of cipher or coding or decoding of the messages. So, I thought it would fun to code this in python Programming Language.
